# Regression with ARIMA errors

As a newly minted MSBA you start working for a large resort hotel managing 1,877 rooms.  A tour operator that you freqently do business with has requested a block of 60 rooms for Aug. 22.  As this operator will pay a discounted rate for each room, your manager is uncertain if she should give this block of rooms to the tour operator, and she  has asked you to provide model-based support for this decision.

Although the price is discounted and it may prevent you from selling some of these rooms at the regular price, if you reject this request, any empty rooms will not generate any reveue and you would have incurred an opportunity cost by not selling these rooms.

After judicious consideration of the economic tradeoffs in the Newsvendor model, you and your manager determine that the block should be assigned to the tour operator only if the probability of your organic demand (excluding the room block in question) is smaller than 67% (i.e., you are on track to achieve a 67% service level).

To address the booking question you examine the following data set and proceed to develop a demand forecast model.
